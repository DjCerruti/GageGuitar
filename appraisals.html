<h2>Appraisals</h2>
<h3>Putting a Price on Your Guitar</h3>
<p>If you own and play a guitar, you 
  know what it's worth in your heart and soul. Strumming its chords to hear its 
  first distinct notes, taking a few lessons in an attempt to become its master, 
  and then playing for friends and having the sound come out just right: smooth 
	jazz, soul-filled rhythm and blues, or powerful rock and roll.</p>
<p>At Gage Vintage Guitars, we can't tell you what your guitar is worth in your heart and soul, but we can tell you what your guitar is worth in today's marketplace. Gage Vintage Guitars has been providing appraisals for nearly 20 years and is owned by Peter Gage. Peter is world renowned for his stormy songs &quot;Firefly&quot; and &quot;Freedom&quot; produced in the 1960's. He is recognized as one of the world's leading experts on guitars and has published several articles in <em id="cg"><a href="https://www.adobe.com">Classic Guitar</a></em> and <em>Musician's World</em>.</p>
